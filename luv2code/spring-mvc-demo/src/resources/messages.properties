# It follows: "Error type.Spring model attribute name.Field name". In order to see the error code,
# print BindingResult in the console and then override here appropriately. We are overriding
# "typeMismatch.customer.freePasses" error code with our own message.


# For a basic example:
# typeMismatch.customer.freePasses=Invalid number
# The format of the error key is:   code + "." + object name + "." + field
 
# To find out the given error code, in your Spring controller, you can log the details of the 
# binding result.

# System.out.println("Binding result: " + theBindingResult);     
typeMismatch.customer.freePasses=Invalid number
